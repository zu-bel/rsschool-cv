Goal: 
- get the skills of "live" web development: creating a website layout, layout, programming internal logic and version control.
Relevant front-end experience: exercises on Codewars.

In my life I constantly have to learn a lot on my own:
- at the first workplace, I had experience creating websites based on the Joomla CMS (including templates);
- the second workplace (related to the design of video surveillance) was radically different from my specialty, but self-study allowed me to do the work;
- the current workplace required the experience that I acquired on my own, reading literature and thematic sites.

Skills: 
- basics of HTML;
- basics of languages.
